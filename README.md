# Template for project folders

I usually use the structure here to organize all my files in one research projects. The sub-folders include:

- doc: project document, recording everything that has been done till now
- data: place to put raw data
- code: stata/python/R code
- literature: related literature
- draft: all versions of drafts
- slide: all versions of slides

Here are the details for each sub-folders.

## ./doc: project document
