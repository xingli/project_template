# Template for project folders

I usually use the structure here to organize all my files in one research projects. The sub-folders include:

- doc: project document, recording everything that has been done till now
- data: place to put raw data
- code: stata/python/R code
- literature: related literature
- draft: all versions of drafts
- slide: all versions of slides

Here are the details for each sub-folders.

## ./doc: project document

1. Write everything in Markdown. Markdown is a mark-up language designed by Daring Fireball. The very first documentation is [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

2. You can easily create a markdown file (.md) using any text editor. There are some better-designed interface, say, [macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) for mac. I have no recommendation for PC, but you may check online review, say, [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/best-markdown-editors-windows/)
